## The power of Vue Components
We love Vue Single-File Components as much as you do. Simple, intuitive and powerful, Nuxt lets you write Vue components in a way that makes sense. Every repetitive task is automated, so you can focus on writing your full-stack Vue application with confidence.

## Static or Dynamic, the choice is yours
Decide what rendering strategy you need at the route level. By leveraging the hybrid rendering, you can get the best of both worlds: the performance of a static site and the interactivity of a dynamic one.
